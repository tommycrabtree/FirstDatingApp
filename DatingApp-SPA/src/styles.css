 In angular.json, I have a ‘styles’ array which is an area where I can import styles,
 including Bootstrap and Font-Awesome.  Because CSS, by its name, is “cascading”, I
 can generally override styles based on the order of my styles.  In other words, the
 Bootstrap styles would be first, then the Font-Awesome styles would be second, and
 then I would add my own custom styles to override Bootstrap and Font-Awesome where
 necessary.  However, the ‘styles’ array in angular.json of the current Angular CLI
 doesn’t respect the order of styles.

 The solution is to import the Bootstrap styles into the ‘styles.css’ of my
 angular.json.  If I go to the actual ‘styles.css’ file in my Solution Explorer,
 there’s a comment telling me that I can “add global styles to this file, and also
 import other style files”.  To import Bootstrap and Font-Awesome into my ‘styles.css’
 file, I type:
 “@import ‘. ./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootsrap.min.css’ ”
 “@import ‘. ./node_modules/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css’ ”

 Now, if I want, I can go to app.component.html to edit any of the html (just to create
 a change that will be affected by Bootstrap and / or Font-Awesome) before verifying
 that my new styles are working on the page.
