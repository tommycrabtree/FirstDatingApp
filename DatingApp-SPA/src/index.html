  The client sees an HTML page on their browser.  The HTML page is being displayed in the
  browser as JavaScript, which has been compiled from TypeScript in the Angular application.

  The SPA, which in this case is an Angular application, gets the values via the API.
  I’m using the DotNetCLI to create the WebAPI.

 app.module.ts “Bootstraps” the AppComponent.  The AppComponent has a Selector,
 which is basically a tag that’s put inside an HTML page.  Since I’m building a SPA,
 there’s only one single HTML page: index.html.  In the body of index.html, I have
 <app-root></app-root>.  This is my AppComponent Selector.  The contents of
 <app-root></app-root> will be replaced by whatever is inside app.component.html.

 index.html doesn’t have a “script” tag inside of it that refers to TypeScript,
 so what calls main.ts?  There is some “behind the scenes Angular magic” that uses
 a “module bundler” and a “task runner” called WebPack.  WebPack bundles my
 application into JavaScript.  At the same time, WebPack will inject this JavaScript
 into my index.html file when it builds it.  The configuration (actually it’s Angular
 abstracting the functionality from WebPack because WebPack can be complex to
 configure) for WebPack can be found in angular.json.  In other words, angular.json
 has the settings that WebPack needs to bundle my application.  These settings
 include a reference to src/main.ts and the index (src/index.html) into which it will
 then inject my JavaScript files.
